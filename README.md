# gilded-rose-refactoring-kata
Refactoring kata from Emily Bache's coding dojo

This kata has the following purposes:
- Base our development in a DDD specification done in class
- Don't modify the Item class from gildedRose.py
- remove a mountain of if-else clauses by creating clases and applying common behaviors
- Learn how inheritance works in python
- simulate an interface in python (in this case an informal interface has been used)
- automate the testing process (in test/test_collector.py we are using a class that help us), because the original tests are in test/stdout.gr

#### see GildedRoseRequirements.txt to understand how the magic shop works
